========

Please fork a branch for yourselves before you get started, and make sure that it has been synced.  DO NOT push your commits directly to the master branch!

If you are unsure of how to fork a repository, check out (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Once as you fork game_dev, creating your own branch, you will have to make a pull request, from the master branch.  You must set your branch on the left of the arrow and the master branch should be on the right.

-- Please make your commit descriptions short but descriptive.  To make sure that we are consistent, please use Camel case and fill any whitespaces in file titles with an underscore ('_').

Thanks and good work!
