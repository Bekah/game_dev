Please fork a branch for yourselves before you get started, and make sure that it has been synced.  DO NOT push your commits directly to the master branch!

If you are unsure of how to fork a repository, check out (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

-- Please make your commit descriptions short but descriptive.  To make sure that we are consistent, please use Camel case and fill any whitespaces in file titles with an underscore ('_').

Thanks and good work!
