Please fork a branch for yourselves before you get started, and make sure that it has been synced/pulled from the master branch.  DO NOT push your commits directly to the master branch!

If you are unaware of how to fork a repository, check out: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo.
If you are unaware of how to make a pull request, check out: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

-- Please make your commit descriptions short but meaningful.  To make sure that we are consistent, please use lower camel case and fill any whitespaces with an underscore (for file titles).

Oh, and remember to document EVERYTHING!

***Thanks and good work!***
